During these days I were using and understanding some tools to solve my idea. Selenium and request libraries

With rerquests libraries i discover that its only work with statict pages or data from the HTML.

The page im using is dynamic in most of the data that the page shows. Image examples

With the selenium as my first option i had some issues configuring the web driver but with some research i found the correct way and configuration use the webdriver for chrome browser
